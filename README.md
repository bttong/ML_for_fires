# ML_for_fires
## Project

Create a predictive model which will take in factors about a natural disaster (location, type etc) and predict whether a certain type of fires may occur.

## Reason

The fire department is already overwhelmed dealing with the natural disaster, so we need to minimize the occurrence and impact of any additional fires under these highten conditions.

## Goal

Input via any rudimentary method
Output in any form

## Stretch or Future Goals

Input via UI - python flask app, R shiny dash etc
Output to include not only predictions but recommendations (both to people and town admin ie shut off power)
